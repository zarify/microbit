# microbit
Code and other files relating to BBC Microbits.

## Guide PDFs
These are some basic programs broken into chunks useful for showing people how to program in MakeCode and MicroPython on the Microbits.
I used them for a conference workshop in 2018, and wanted to show basic features of the Microbit as well as equivalence of MakeCode and MicroPython code.

## Laser Cutter Carry case
This is a design I use for a laser-cut box insert for carrying my Microbits, USB cables, and battery packs.
Dimensions of the bounding box (for fitting to a plastic box) are included in the plans.
One of the nice things about this design is the slot for the Microbit also fits the stubby USB cables that come with the starter kit, so if you don't store USB cables, you can use them for more Microbits.
