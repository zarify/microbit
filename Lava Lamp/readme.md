# Lava Lamp
Repo for making a lava lamp style project out of WS2812B RGB LEDs, a stepper motor, a Micro:bit, a ping pong ball, and laser cut translucent acrylic and wood.

The idea is the ping pong ball has a hole cut into it for the LED. The LED is wired up using very thin bare copper wires, which are fed through a pulley system driven by the stepper motor, in order to make it 'float' up and down like the bubbles in a lava lamp.

The LED also slowly shifts hue and brightness as it floats up and down.
